After data has been placed in database, use the query files within this 
directory to produce csv files.

The queries within the files have "XX" in certain fields, so modify 
accordingly.  

You may want to test the query by cutting and pasting into mysql command
line.  Once you are satisfied with the result, create a csv file using
the command below.  Be sure and fill in hostname ('-h' and password 
approprately. 

mysql -h db_host.lanl.gov -u atorrez --password=password -D mpi_io_test_pro < testquery.sql | sed 's/\t/,/g' > out.csv
